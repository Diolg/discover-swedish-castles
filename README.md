## Website for history or cultural recreation lovers

# The Project description

“The best castles in Sweden: my choice” is a project that based on my own experience will allow tourists, newcomers, expats, aesthetes (lovers of history or cultural recreation), nature lovers to discover Swedish castles as perfect destinations for active/passive recreation. The website will help to: 
-  Save time in searching for users new destinations for recreation in Sweden.  
-  Explore Sweden from a new perspective, based on the owners recommendations and experience with that exact place.  
- Discover new locations not so far from Sctockholm with good cuisine, nature spots for hiking/long walks, SPA.  

The main purpose of the project is to create a website that allows users due to the easy navigation on different kinds of devices to:
- Easily find the website owner’s top-3 favorite castles on the integrated Google Map.
- Get a maximum of possible information about these locations to plan their trip.
- Address to the website owner inqueries/questions/tips/suggestions through the interactive contact form.

# UX
The purpose of the project is to design a responsive website for all kinds of devices (mostly for large screens and smartphones) for making navigation fast and efficient. Due to the easy navigation and laconic design of the website users should have the possibility to:
* Clearly understand that the project is about the website’s owner choice of 3 favourite castles in Sweden.
* Clearly understand that due to many factors castles are a good choice for recreation.
* Clearly find out what castles are presented.
* Clearly understand why the owner has chosen exactly these castles.
(These 4 points are covered on the HOME page with the brief answers on these questions.)
* Clearly understand that users can get brief information about the presented castles with the help of the website and be redirected to the official websites’ pages:
This will be provided with the buttom on the home page (index.html), which leads to the map page(map.html) with the integrated Google Map with the castles locations markers on it.  

The brief information on a chosen castle can be obtained due to the following steps:
1. Click on  marker on the Google Map
2. An info window with the basic information appears (the year of building, possibility to book hotel/spa/restaurant, and a link to the official website with extended information on the chosen castle)
* Clearly understand that in case of additional questions, inquieries or suggestions users can easily reach out the owner of the project through the interactive contact form, which is provided on a separate page called “CONTACT ME”.  

The website consists of 3 pages, including: HOME, CASTLES ON THE MAP, CONTACT ME.  
Each page is responsive and consists of the collapsible navigation menu bar with the related information and the footer with copyright and social media icons. 

The HOME page includes:
- A banner with brief description of the website idea

# Design

## Colour Scheme
- The main colors used throughout the website page are: white (#fff), a shafe of red rgb(194, 4, 4), red rgb(241, 26, 26). I got also inspired by the light-dark-blue (#f2f5f7) color, which is widely used on the official website of one of the castles presented on my website the [Gorvanslott](https://www.gorvalnsslott.se/en/).
- The first thing the visior sees when enters the website is the “Home” page with the banner with the main message for visitors, the navigation bar in a light background color with the logo on the left up side presented in black-red colors with a hover effect and a navigation menu. While scrolling down the user explores more information about the owner’s idea to share the information about Swedish castles as attractive destination for recreation as well as explanation for the castles choice. At the end of each page visitors see the footer with copyright and social media icons.  
 
The “Home” page is presented mostly in a blog style, where the owner shares personal choices. To make it easy to read and easy to percieve the information the owner used:
1. A castle’s image for banner to make the main idea clear for the first time visitors. 
2. Other castles’ environmental images to create an atmosphere of brightness and to arouse the interest of the visitor to visit castles.
3. An exquisite background color to make the page full of spaces.
4. A call to action and the button taking to the “Map” page presented in red colors in order to attract visitors to make an action and at the same time to bring some contrast to the ”Home” page.
5. The footer with copyright and social media at the end of the page is presented without any background color to keep the feeling of the space on the page.  

All together: the light navbar, transparent footer as well as colorful images of banner and environmental images, the light background provide simplicity, style, convey the main idea and let focus on the main infromation.
